    description:
      'As a frontend developer, I wanted to create a personal blog that showcased my skills in building modern web applications.\nTo accomplish this, I used Next.js, a popular framework for building React applications, to create a fast and responsive blog that loads quickly and performs well. \nI also used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to create a modern and minimalist design for the blog. Finally, I integrated GraphCMS, a headless CMS, to manage the content for each blog post and make it easy to publish new content.',
